# The Choban Algorithm

The Choban Algorithm is a website that was created for my first project assignment in the Code Institute course. Its purpose is to inspire people to live a more natural lifestyle. In the future, my dream is to further develop this site into a blog and possibly even a podcast. The primary goal of the Choban Algorithm is to provide inspiration for those seeking a natural way of life. \ View the live page [here](https://birgerosterberg.github.io/thechobanalgorithm/)

## Design

The Choban Algorithm website is designed as a one-page website with links to different parts of the page. This layout provides a smooth and seamless experience for users who can easily navigate through the different sections of the site. The navigation menu at the top of the page is sticky, meaning it stays in place as users scroll down the page, making it easy to access at all times. Each section of the page has its own unique content.

By presenting all this information on one page with links to different sections, users can easily find what they're looking for without having to navigate through multiple pages. The result is a user-friendly and visually appealing website that encourages visitors to explore and engage with the content.
