              Choban is a word that evokes a sense of connection with nature, a
              deep appreciation for the earth, and a love for traditional ways
              of life. In the urban dictionary, it refers to a shepherd, someone
              who tends to flocks of sheep or goats in rural areas. But to those
              who understand the meaning behind the word, it is so much more
              than that.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              To be a choban is to be intimately connected with the land and the
              animals that inhabit it. It is a way of life that has been passed
              down from generation to generation, a tradition that embodies the
              very essence of nature. The choban spends his days wandering the
              hills and valleys, following his flock as they graze on the
              grasses and shrubs that grow wild and free.

              <i class="pimp__icon fa-solid fa-leaf fa-xl"></i>
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="img__txt__about">
          <div class="para__about">
            <p>
              There is a simplicity to the choban's life that is both refreshing
              and inspiring. He carries with him only what he needs - a staff to
              guide his flock, a few basic tools to mend fences and build
              shelters, and a deep knowledge of the natural world around him. He
              is in tune with the changing seasons, the ebb and flow of the
              tides, and the rhythms of life itself.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              And yet, despite his simple way of life, the choban is a master of
              his craft. He knows the individual personalities of each of his
              animals, can read the signs of the weather with uncanny accuracy,
              and can find his way across the most treacherous terrain with
              ease. He is a true steward of the land, a guardian of the earth,
              and a testament to the power of tradition.

              <span>The Choban Algorithm</span> is to love nature with a fierce
              and unbridled passion. It is to understand that we are all a part
              of something greater than ourselves, that we are all connected to
              the earth and to each other in ways that we may never fully
              comprehend. It is a way of life that reminds us of the beauty and
              simplicity of the natural world, and of our own place within it.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              As much as the choban's way of life is steeped in tradition, we
              are those who seek to blend it with modern sensibilities. We have
              decided to leave the city and embrace the choban lifestyle. We
              will try to bring with us a modern touch, incorporating
              sustainable practices into our daily routine, such as using solar
              power to light our home and composting our waste, find innovative
              ways to grow our crops and use our water like it is flowing gold.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              We have not grown up tending flocks, but we have a passion for
              nature and a desire to live a more intentional and sustainable
              life. We learn from the choban's wisdom, and in turn, bring our
              own ideas to the table, creating a beautiful blend of tradition
              and innovation.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Together, we will find a way to honor the past while embracing the
              future. We want to be a testament to the power of human ingenuity
              and adaptability, and to the enduring beauty and resilience of
              nature.

            <h2>Permaculture</h2>
            <p>
              Permaculture is an approach to land management and settlement
              design that adopts arrangements observed in flourishing natural
              ecosystems. It includes a set of design principles derived using
              whole-systems thinking. It applies these principles in fields such
              as regenerative agriculture, town planning, rewilding, and
              community resilience.
            </p>
            <p>
              Permaculture originally came from "permanent agriculture", but was
              later adjusted to mean "permanent culture", incorporating social
              aspects. The term was coined in 1978 by Bill Mollison and David
              Holmgren, who formulated the concept in opposition to modern
              industrialized methods instead adopting a more traditional or
              "natural" approach to agriculture.
