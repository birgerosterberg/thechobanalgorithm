          <p>
            Choban is a word that evokes a sense of connection with nature, a
            deep appreciation for the earth, and a love for traditional ways
            of life. In the urban dictionary, it refers to a shepherd, someone
            who tends to flocks of sheep or goats in rural areas. But to those
            who understand the meaning behind the word, it is so much more
            than that.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            To be a choban is to be intimately connected with the land and the
            animals that inhabit it. It is a way of life that has been passed
            down from generation to generation, a tradition that embodies the
            very essence of nature. The choban spends his days wandering the
            hills and valleys, following his flock as they graze on the
            grasses and shrubs that grow wild and free.

            <i class="pimp__icon fa-solid fa-leaf fa-xl"></i>
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="img__txt__about">
        <div class="para__about">
          <p>
            There is a simplicity to the choban's life that is both refreshing
            and inspiring. He carries with him only what he needs - a staff to
            guide his flock, a few basic tools to mend fences and build
            shelters, and a deep knowledge of the natural world around him. He
            is in tune with the changing seasons, the ebb and flow of the
            tides, and the rhythms of life itself.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            And yet, despite his simple way of life, the choban is a master of
            his craft. He knows the individual personalities of each of his
            animals, can read the signs of the weather with uncanny accuracy,
            and can find his way across the most treacherous terrain with
            ease. He is a true steward of the land, a guardian of the earth,
            and a testament to the power of tradition.

            <span>The Choban Algorithm</span> is to love nature with a fierce
            and unbridled passion. It is to understand that we are all a part
            of something greater than ourselves, that we are all connected to
            the earth and to each other in ways that we may never fully
            comprehend. It is a way of life that reminds us of the beauty and
            simplicity of the natural world, and of our own place within it.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            As much as the choban's way of life is steeped in tradition, we
            are those who seek to blend it with modern sensibilities. We have
            decided to leave the city and embrace the choban lifestyle. We
            will try to bring with us a modern touch, incorporating
            sustainable practices into our daily routine, such as using solar
            power to light our home and composting our waste, find innovative
            ways to grow our crops and use our water like it is flowing gold.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            We have not grown up tending flocks, but we have a passion for
            nature and a desire to live a more intentional and sustainable
            life. We learn from the choban's wisdom, and in turn, bring our
            own ideas to the table, creating a beautiful blend of tradition
            and innovation.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Together, we will find a way to honor the past while embracing the
            future. We want to be a testament to the power of human ingenuity
            and adaptability, and to the enduring beauty and resilience of
            nature.

            Nestled on the beautiful island of Gotland lies a place where we
            dream of creating a permaculture farm and living in harmony with
            nature. The lush green fields are a canvas for the
            vision we have in mind. A place where we can create a sustainable life
            that is both fulfilling and respectful of the environment.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            There's something magical about the way the sunlight filters through
            the trees and the gentle breeze that carries the scent of
            wildflowers. The island's unique natural environment offers an
            opportunity to create a diverse ecosystem that fosters growth and
            abundance. We envision a farm where we can cultivate organic fruits
            and vegetables, and raise animals that roam free in the fields. A
            place where the soil is rich and nourished, and the water crystal
            clear.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            As we imagine waking up each day to the sound of birdsong and
            the smell of fresh air, our hearts fill with joy and excitement. The
            prospect of living in such close proximity to nature fills us with a
            sense of purpose and fulfillment. Walking through the
            fields, barefoot and in tune with the rhythms of the earth.
            Breathing in the pure air and feeling the sun on our skin as we work
            in harmony with the land.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            The idea of creating a permaculture farm on Gotland fills us with
            passion. It's a place where we wish to live in
            harmony with the environment and contribute to its preservation.
            It's a place where we can learn from nature, and cultivate a
            sustainable lifestyle that nourishes both the land and our souls.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Join us on our journey as we navigate the challenges and rewards of creating a permaculture farm,
            in harmony with nature. It's not an easy task, but it's one that drives us forward every day. We're
            committed to learning from our mistakes and celebrating our victories, smal and big. We believe that living
            in harmony
            with nature is not only good for the environment, but it's good for our souls as well. Let's create a
            community of people who are committed to sustainability and who believe in the power of living in harmony
            to create a better future.

          <h2>Permaculture</h2>
          <p>
            Permaculture is an approach to land management and settlement
            design that adopts arrangements observed in flourishing natural
            ecosystems. It includes a set of design principles derived using
            whole-systems thinking. It applies these principles in fields such
            as regenerative agriculture, town planning, rewilding, and
            community resilience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Permaculture originally came from "permanent agriculture", but was
            later adjusted to mean "permanent culture", incorporating social
            aspects. The term was coined in 1978 by Bill Mollison and David
            Holmgren, who formulated the concept in opposition to modern
            industrialized methods instead adopting a more traditional or
            "natural" approach to agriculture.
